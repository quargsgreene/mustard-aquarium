Mustard Aquarium
================

When the user presses the 'Eustachian Food Slide' button, the corresponding [song](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5btburvpop4sp0n/Eustachian%20Food%20Slide%202%2048k%2010192022.mp3?dl=0) will be streamed at a random speed and direction between between 0 (exclusive) and 2 (inclusive) times the original speed. While the audio streams, the amplitude data from the audio file will appear in a visualizer on the screen which is shared between a collection of yellow rectangles and circles in an assortment of colors. If you use a screen reader, you can access a secret message, as well as an alert window and burst of pink noise.
